# Color-based Tracker for Monitering Ants
This project is to detect ants with different colors going down to holes. The purpose of the research is to track if the colored ants go into the holes with the same color or not. By figuring out, the inner structure of colony whether it is a collective colony or the federation of individual colonies can be investigated. (Full House? or Apartment?)
